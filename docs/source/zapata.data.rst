zapata.data module
==================

This module contains the two main functions of the data interface (see below for usage details):

- :meth:`inquire_catalogue<zapata.data.inquire_catalogue>` : Retrieve requested dataset informative structure from catalogue 
- :meth:`read_data<zapata.data.read_data>` : Load into a DataArray the requested variable from specified dataset

The data extraction from each dataset is performed by the function :meth:`load_dataarray<zapata.data.load_dataarray>` that contains the `default` driver for extraction operations and also handles the call to specific data drivers, which are contained in module `data_drivers.py` (see `data_drivers`_).

The dataset catalogue is located within the zapata library, named `catalogue.yml` (YAML format).
