# Zapata
## Computational and Mapping Library   

A revolutionary library for analysis and plotting of meteorological data. The mapping is based on cartopy and GEOCAT libraries from NCAR.
It uses `xarray` as a basic data structure. 

The folder `docs` contains documentation for the modules. The subdirectory `html` contains the html file for the documentation produced by Sphinx. 

The directory 

The module `data` contains the information on the data banks. The routine `data_grid` in `data` must be modified to the location of the basic data for each installation.

## Setup working environemt
Python working environment can be setup using the provided conda environment.yml file:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

`conda activate zapata`
